		"Life Fiber Synchronize! Kamui Senketsu!"

		From the anime series 'KILL la KILL' comes a rerelease of the main character looking to avenge her father - figma Ryuko Matoi!

		Using the smooth yet posable joints of figma, you can act out a variety of different scenes.
		A flexible plastic is used for important areas, allowing proportions to be kept without compromising posability.
		She comes a smiling expression, a shouting expression and an expression with clenched teeth for combat scenes.
		Her Scissor Blade is included in both standard form and Decapitation Mode.
		An articulated figma stand is included.
